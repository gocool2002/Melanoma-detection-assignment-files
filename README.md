## General Information
The data set contains 2357 images for 9 types of skin cancer

<!-- You don't have to answer all the questions - just the ones relevant to your project. -->

## Conclusions
We have seen
- seborrheic keratosis has the least number of samples - 77
- pigmented benign keratosis (464 samples), melanoma (450 samples) dominate the data in terms proportionate number of samples

Overfitting is reduced after drop out and model performance improves after batch normalization.
Class imbalance is addressed by enhancing the no. of images in each class
